####Developer Notes
In order to build this project, you will need to create a file on your local machine called `dev-mpdstats-ds.xml`
under `mpdstats-jbossconfig/src/main/resources`. You can find the proper values on the servers. 

Another thing you will need, in your settings.xml file, is a property named `<clover.license>`. 
You can get the value from one of the developers.
