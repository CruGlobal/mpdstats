# This file is used to verify that undeploying etimesheet doesn't leak a classloader, which causes a
# PermGen out of memory problem when repeatedly deploying and undeploying.
# The goal is to allow developers to repeatedly redeploy the app without worrying about having to restart jboss, which is
# timeconsuming.
