# This file is for defining aliases to make project development easier
# It assumes you're executing it from the project root directory; ie, that you run
#   source/src/build/mvnsh/aliases.msh
# To do this easily, set up a mvnsh.rc file in your home .m2 directory (eg /Users/mattdrees/.m2/mvnsh.rc) that aliases this
# command; see http://arkham.ccci.org/svn/java/trunk/non-java/maven-config/mvnsh.rc for an example


# this allows us to avoid running the find:find goal on every mvn execution; this accomplishes the same
# purpose (populating ${root.directory.marker.path) as
# the find:find goal, but the property will be persistent, so it only needs to be executed once.
set -m property root.directory.marker.path ${shell.user.dir}/root.directory.marker
